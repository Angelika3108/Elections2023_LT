### Analysis of 2023 Lithuania municipality elections results using Python.
#### Used Python libraries: Pandas, GeoPandas, Matplotlib, and Contextily
#### Analitics methods: proportions_ztest from Statsmodels

1. Made Python code with conditional logic (if...else) for evaluation of election’s (presidential, mayor, Seimas) and referendum’s (consultative, mandatory, constitutional) outcomes based on Lithuanian electoral laws. 

User inputs total number of registered voters in election district, number of voters who participated, candidate’s name and his votes count or votes count for passing the proposal on referendum. 

And then user gets the answer: which candidate won or if there will be 2nd round of election or if the proposal will be passed into motion or not enough registered voters participated.

2.  Analyzed the 2023 2d-round mayor of municipality elections results with a focus on voter’s support via mail:


•	Created a new dataframe to identify candidates with statistically higher support via mail in a municipality 


•	Visualized election data for statistically higher support via mail in a districts on a map of Lithuania
